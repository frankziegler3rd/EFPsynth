## Final Project: Digital Synth with Mozzi library

### Group Members and Responsibilities
Well it's just me. I wrote all of the code, meaning the config and the audio logic, and built the circuit on my own.

### Components and Interfaces They Used
- PAM8403 Amplifier: GPIO through resistor/capacitor
- 3 watt 8 ohm speaker powered through amplifier
- 5 potentiometers, analog GPIO

### Libraries That Were Used

Primarily just the Mozzi library and the oscillator class, and a range of pre-computed wavetable oscillators
